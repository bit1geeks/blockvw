# Simple Blockchain in Rust

This project implements a simple blockchain system in Rust. It allows users to add transactions, mine blocks, and display the blockchain.

## Features

- Create and add transactions.
- Generate blocks using SHA-256 for hashing.
- Display the entire chain of blocks.

## Technologies Used

- Rust
- `serde` for data serialization
- `sha2` for hashing
- `chrono` for handling timestamps

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (the package manager for Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-blockchain.git
   cd simple-blockchain
